# Revou_Data_Analysis_project
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under RevoU Full Stack Data Analysis program.

RevoU data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and Tableu as I build a portfolio of projects .
